# Section 1: General ethics 
### Answer to 1.2.1
The most generic definition for ethics I could find on Ethics within the encyclopedia was this in African Ethics "The ethics of a society is embedded in the ideas and beliefs about what is right or wrong, what is a good or bad character; it is also embedded in the conceptions of satisfactory social relations and attitudes held by the members of the society; it is embedded, furthermore, in the forms or patterns of behavior that are considered by the members of the society to bring about social harmony and cooperative living, justice, and fairness." The three domains of Ethics that were most novel and striking to me were of Business ethics, Deontological Ethics, and Aristotleâ€™s Ethics. I liked Aristrotle's stance on not needing education to know how to know what goodness is. Deontological Ethic's basis that the morality is determined whether an action is right or wrong and not good or bad, so it intrigued me to see what most parents say to their kids like, "I'll make the right choice for you whether you like it or not." And I was intrigued by Business Ethics soley for the fact that I believe there are businesses that have practices that could be potentionally harmful for their employees. 

### Answer to 1.2.2
I believe Aristotle places the burden of reponsibilty on practical wisdom. He believes we need a proper appreciation for the good things we have such as friendships, pleasure, honor, etc., and to achieve an understanding for any cases, we require a proper upbringings and habits. Not only would we require understandings, we also need socializing to put our general understandings into practice in ways that would suit each occasion. 

# Section 2: Applied ethics
### Answer to 2.2.2 
If all people were ethical in all their interactions, we would obviate lawmakers that give us the ethical rules to follow, because we wouldn't be causing chaos amongst each other. 

### Discussion for 2.2.3
A recent extreme case where the U.S. governments chose to place the existance of the country ahead of the countries individualistic needs was with the COVID-19 Pandemic. I would prefer to favor the group over the interests on individuals, but my idea on balancing proves to be rather unethical. Those who want to continue their lives back to normal, should be allowed to so long as they continue to wear masks and be sanitary. I know of a few individuals who would rather risk their life as well and lives of the members around them because they hate how they can't properly breathe in masks. The best I can come up with is letting people do what they want. Some believe they're being abused or tortured by Stay-at-home orders and others are putting the public ahead of them by staying at home. It's a tough situation, much like assisted suicides by doctors. 

# Section 3: Current ethics examples
### Discussion in 3.2.1
Some inequalities and conflicts that arrised in Emerging Code of Ethics for Disaster Relief are that though lesser known cities or places do not receive the same amount of care as those places who do, some times people who come to help aren't culturally knowledgable about how the area operates, and larger known places receive more funding for disasters. I find this odd since a fire anywhere, causes the same damage and thus should be given the same amount of care and respect to treat it. 

### Discussion in 3.2.2
Ethical issues brought up by the COVID-19 Pandemic could be of: 
1) Enforcing stay at home orders to those who are not afraid
2) Choosing between staying at home to protect the people from illness and/or death or allowing citizens to continue on with their lives and care for themselves
3) The closing of businesses to practice being safe, causes many to lose their jobs and have trouble paying bills or buying food

# Section 4: Engineering ethics
### Writing on item 4.2.1
After reading ACM'S Code of Ethics, I've come to realize they had to create this specific code for engingeers to avoid harmful work that could impact the public, the company, and privacys. When signing up for this class, I always invisioned myself being like the cartoon character Jimmy Nuetron, working in my lab to make fun projects. Not once had I considered how people can use computer science/engineering for evil. 

### Writing on item 4.2.2
Microsoft's Open Source Code of Conduct addresses ethical behaviors that are expected in Microsoft-managed open source communities. I believe their most important element of ethical behavior is to understand disagreements and resolve them constructively. An OSS from Microsoft we have been using is Microsoft Teams. 

### Writing on item 4.2.3
According to the article on Data Ethics from the Royal Society, social acceptability or social preferability must be guiding prinicples for any data science. When working with data science, we must ensure the respect of human rights. 

### Writing on item 4.2.4
A technical conference such as THe Internation Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) would need it's own Code of Coduct because we're all human and allow our emotions to get the better of us. Everyone has their own way of thinking and learning, so when you create a conference to exchange ideas, have the freedom of thought and expression, and bring scientists together to debate, so may run into disagreements or violence.

### Writing on item 4.2.5
In Principles of AI Development at Google, Google appears to be concerned with the risks of AI being misused. They seem to be encouraging policy makers to establish a frameworkd that will underpin AI's development. 

### Writing on item 4.2.6
Ethics are moral principles that guide a person's behavior or activities. When practicing ethical behaviors, we generally place the goods or rights of the world and its inhabitants first. Hacking is when someone breaches someone's data in order to collect data. Hacking is unethical for the most part. We could combine ethics and hacking to create ethical hacking. A hacker could use their abilities to breach so the good of a company such as warding off negative impacting hackers.
