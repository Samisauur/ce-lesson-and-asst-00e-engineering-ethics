# Section 1: General ethics 
### Answer to 1.2.1
The most generic definition for ethics I could find on Ethics within the encyclopedia was this in African Ethics "The ethics of a society is embedded in the ideas and beliefs about what is right or wrong, what is a good or bad character; it is also embedded in the conceptions of satisfactory social relations and attitudes held by the members of the society; it is embedded, furthermore, in the forms or patterns of behavior that are considered by the members of the society to bring about social harmony and cooperative living, justice, and fairness." The three domains of Ethics that were most novel and striking to me were of Business ethics, Deontological Ethics, and Aristotleâ€™s Ethics. I liked Aristrotle's stance on not needing education to know how to know what goodness is. Deontological Ethic's basis that the morality is determined whether an action is right or wrong and not good or bad, so it intrigued me to see what most parents say to their kids like, "I'll make the right choice for you whether you like it or not." And I was intrigued by Business Ethics soley for the fact that I believe there are businesses that have practices that could be potentionally harmful for their employees. 

### Answer to 1.2.2
I believe Aristotle places the burden of reponsibilty on practical wisdom. He believes we need a proper appreciation for the good things we have such as friendships, pleasure, honor, etc., and to achieve an understanding for any cases, we require a proper upbringings and habits. Not only would we require understandings, we also need socializing to put our general understandings into practice in ways that would suit each occasion. 

# Section 2: Applied ethics
### Answer to 2.2.2 
If all people were ethical in all their interactions, we would obviate lawmakers that give us the ethical rules to follow, because we wouldn't be causing chaos amongst each other. 

### Discussion for 2.2.3
A recent extreme case where the U.S. governments chose to place the existance of the country ahead of the countries individualistic needs was with the COVID-19 Pandemic. I would prefer to favor the group over the interests on individuals, but my idea on balancing proves to be rather unethical. Those who want to continue their lives back to normal, should be allowed to so long as they continue to wear masks and be sanitary. I know of a few individuals who would rather risk their life as well and lives of the members around them because they hate how they can't properly breathe in masks. The best I can come up with is letting people do what they want. Some believe they're being abused or tortured by Stay-at-home orders and others are putting the public ahead of them by staying at home. It's a tough situation, much like assisted suicides by doctors.
